Even more complicated commands that don't display the contents should not be considered: eg \"find . -type f -exec ls -la {} + | sort -k5 -nr | head -5\"\n\nFirst, determine if the command displays the contents of the files. If it does, then <is_displaying_contents> tag should be true. If it does not, then <is_displaying_contents> tag should be false.\n\nFormat your response as:\n<is_displaying_contents>\ntrue\n</is_displaying_contents>\n\n<filepaths>\npath/to/file1\npath/to/file2\n</filepaths>\n\nIf no files are read or modified, return empty filepaths tags:\n<filepaths>\n</filepaths>\n\nDo not include any other text in your response.",
